A WIP, CQB mod for Single Player Tarkov and FIKA

---

## Features:
- **Tapping limbs to inform the player that you are ready.**
- **Follow Close behind player, interact with a player's shoulder to follow on that side with your weapon, to help clear.**
    
## Planned Features
- **Better tapping system, bounce camera slightly to signify rather than a notification (WIP)**
    
## Installation
    
You will need **SPT version 3.11.x** installed, and the latest FIKA mod installed as well. Unzip and drag the mod into the root of your SPT install, where the EXE is located.
The mod should not be under the path *SPTLocation/BepInEx/plugins/CQB.dll*.

CQB uses a typical C# project structure and can be built by simply running the default `Debug` task. After Rider
finishes building the project, you can find the built mod in `bin/Debug`. Feel free to open a pull request!

If you are going to help develop the mod (which I highly recommend!) I only ask that you add your feature to the bullet point list
